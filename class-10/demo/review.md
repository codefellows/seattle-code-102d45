## CSS

- how to get things side by side
- float - you can float an element, and the elements that are after it will flow alongside the floated element.

## HTML

- ordered list vs. unordered list
  - Ordered list is numbered
  - Unordered lists are bulleted
  - Both ol & ul should always have li elements for each item.
